## WordPress Integration

When integrating the footer component into the Adtrak WordPress, ensure you have a "Primary" and "Secondary" menu created in the backend. Also ensure you have your "company info" created in Site Options. Copy and paste the Fractal code into `footer.twig` and do a file search for `"@INTEGRATION"` and follow the instructions.
